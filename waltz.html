                    <strong>The waltz</strong> is a classical ballroom dance that originated in the Southern
                    German-speaking areas of Austria and Bavaria during the 17th century. It is a smooth, elegant, and
                    graceful dance characterized by a distinctive 3/4 time signature, where dancers move in a closed
                    position, rotating in a series of natural and reverse turns.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    The roots of the waltz can be traced back to the 16th-century Europe, with references to a sliding
                    or gliding dance, including the volte, that eventually evolved into the waltz. Printmaker Hans
                    Sebald Beham and French philosopher Michel de Montaigne made early mentions of such dances in the
                    16th century, describing close holds and face-to-face contact.

                    Around 1750, a couples dance called Walzer became popular among the lower classes in Bavaria, Tyrol,
                    and Styria. The LÃ¤ndler, a country dance in 3/4 time, gained popularity in Bohemia, Austria, and
                    Bavaria. While the upper classes continued dancing minuets, the lower classes embraced the waltz,
                    and it spread from the countryside to the city suburbs.

                    In the late 18th century, the waltz shocked some aristocrats. In Sophie von La Roche's 1771 novel, a
                    character criticized the "shameless, indecent whirling-dance of the Germans." Vienna, particularly
                    around the 1780s, played a crucial role in popularizing the waltz. It became fashionable in Vienna
                    and quickly spread to other countries, reaching England in 1791 and being introduced to Sussex by
                    German Legion soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars.

                    The waltz gained prominence in Britain during the Regency period, with Dorothea Lieven's endorsement
                    making it respectable. Thomas Raikes noted the sensation it caused in English society in 1813. Lord
                    Byron penned a sardonic tribute to the dance that same year, and influential dance master Thomas
                    Wilson published a description of the correct method of waltzing in 1816.

                    Despite initial resistance, the waltz found acceptance even in exclusive clubs like Almack's in
                    London, although it was considered "riotous and indecent" until as late as 1825. The waltz's closed
                    position became a model for the creation of numerous ballroom dances, and over time, various folk
                    and ballroom waltz variations emerged.

                <h2>Variants</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 19th and early 20th century, numerous different waltz forms existed, including versions
                    performed
                    in 3
                    4, 3
                    8 or 6
                    8 (sauteuse), and 5
                    4 time (5
                    4 waltz, half and half).

                    In the 1910s, a form called the Hesitation Waltz was introduced by Vernon and Irene Castle.It
                    incorporated "hesitations" and was danced to fast music. A hesitation is basically a halt on the
                    standing foot during the full waltz bar, with the moving foot suspended in the air or slowly
                    dragged.
                    Similar figures (Hesitation Change, Drag Hesitation, and Cross Hesitation) are incorporated in the
                    International Standard Waltz Syllabus.

                    The Country Western Waltz is mostly progressive, moving counter clock wise around the dance floor.
                    Both
                    the posture and frame are relaxed, with posture bordering on a slouch. The exaggerated hand and arm
                    gestures of some ballroom styles are not part of this style. Couples may frequently dance in the
                    promenade position, depending on local preferences. Within Country Western waltz, there is the
                    Spanish
                    Waltz and the more modern (for the late 1930s- early 1950s) Pursuit Waltz. At one time it was
                    considered
                    ill treatment for a man to make the woman walk backwards in some locations.

                    In California, the waltz was banned by Mission priests until 1834 because of the "closed" dance
                    position.Thereafter a Spanish Waltz was danced. This Spanish Waltz was a combination of dancing
                    around the room in closed position, and a "formation" dance of two couples facing each other and
                    performing a sequence of steps."Valse a Trois Temps" was the "earliest" waltz step, and the Rye
                    Waltz was preferred as a couple dance.
