                <h2>Origin</h2>
                <p>
                    Salsa is one of the most popular types of <strong>Latin dances</strong> practiced worldwide. The
                    term
                    "salsa" was coined by Johnny Pacheco in the 1960s in New York, as an umbrella term for Cuban dance
                    music being played in the city at the time. Salsa as a dance emerged soon after, being a combination
                    of mambo (which was popular in New York in the 1950s) as well as Latin dances such as Son and Rumba
                    as well as American dances such as swing, hustle, and tap.

                    Like many other forms of <strong>Latin dances</strong>, salsa may trace its roots back to Cuba,
                    where
                    it is widely accepted that early radio is responsible for American artists to begin incorporating
                    elements of Latin American rhythms into their own music and eventually into their own styles of
                    dance.

                    As salsa music spread to other countries, different styles emerged such as Cuban and Colombian
                    salsa.
                    Salsa remains popular globally with ethnographic research into salsa having been done as far as
                    Benin, and Ghana.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Salsa dance steps can be done individually, but Salsa is most popularly known as a partnered dance
                    where the lead takes the follower through a series of spins and turn patterns to music. Salsa's
                    tempo
                    ranges from about 150bpm (beats per minute) to around 250bpm, although most dancing is done to music
                    somewhere between 160 and 220bpm. The basic Salsa dance rhythm consists of taking three steps for
                    every four beats of music. Salsa dancers can also break apart to dance solo, known as "shines".

                    The two main styles of partnered salsa dancing are linear and circular. In linear salsa, dance
                    couples
                    remain in their "slot," with each dancer switching places from one side of the slot to the other,
                    similar to West Coast Swingâ€” New York-style salsa and LA-style salsa are both danced this way. The
                    second style of partnered salsa dancing is circular salsa. Here, dancers circle around each other,
                    reminiscent of East Coast Swing. Both Cuban and Colombian salsa follow this circular pattern.

                    Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has become very common for both men
                    and women: footwork, armwork, body movement, spins, body isolations, shoulder shimmies, body rolls,
                    hand styling, acrobatics, and even lifts.

                <p>

                    Salsa dance socials are commonly held in night clubs, bars, ballrooms, restaurants, and outside,
                    especially if part of an outdoor festival. Salsa dancing is an international dance that can be found
                    in most metropolitan cities in the world. Festivals are held annually, often called a "Salsa
                    Congress," in various host cities aimed to attract a variety of salsa dancers from other cities and
                    countries. The events bring dancers together to share their passion for the dance, build community,
                    and share moves and tips. These events usually include salsa dance performers, live salsa music,
                    workshops, open dancing, and contests. On the other hand, Salsa dancing is also done in very
                    informal
                    settings, such as parties in a home or backyard. Salsa dancing is often seen as an important
                    cultural
                    expression by persons living in certain Hispanic regions or people whose family heritage comes from
                    those regions.
