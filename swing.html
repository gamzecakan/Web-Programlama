                    <u>Swing dance</u> is a diverse collection of social dances that emerged alongside
                    <strong>the swing</strong> style of jazz music from the 1920s to the 1940s. Various swing dance
                    styles were developed during this period, including Charleston, Balboa, Lindy Hop, and Collegiate
                    Shag. The Lindy Hop, originating in Harlem in the early 1930s, is the most widely recognized among
                    them today. While many <strong>swing dances</strong> originated in African-<strong>American
                    </strong>communities, some, like Balboa, developed outside of these communities but were influenced
                    by the swing era.The term "swing dance" wasn't commonly used until the latter half of the 20th
                    century.
