                    <strong>Tango</strong>is a partner dance and social dance that originated in the 1880s along the Río
                    de la Plata, the natural border between Argentina and Uruguay. The tango was born in the
                    impoverished port areas of these countries from a combination of Argentine Milonga, Spanish-Cuban
                    Habanera, and Uruguayan Candombe celebrations.It was frequently practiced in the brothels and
                    bars of ports, where business owners employed bands to entertain their patrons.It then spread to
                    the rest of the world.Many variations of this dance currently exist around the world.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    <strong>Tango dance</strong> is a genre influenced by African and <strong>European</strong>
                    cultures, originating in Buenos Aires and
                    Montevideo. Dances from candombe ceremonies of former African slaves played a role in shaping the
                    modern-day tango. Initially emerging in working-class districts, the dance's music evolved from a
                    fusion of various European music forms.

                    The terms "tango" and "tambo" were initially used around the River Plate basin to refer to musical
                    gatherings of slaves, with records of colonial authorities attempting to ban such gatherings as
                    early as 1789.

                    While initially just one of many dances, tango quickly gained popularity across society. Theaters
                    and street barrel organs helped spread it from suburbs to working-class slums, densely populated
                    with European immigrants.

                    As tango began to spread internationally around 1900, it faced conservative cultural norms, and its
                    perceived sexual nature made it controversial for public display. This led to cultural shock,
                    especially due to the novel combination of African, Native American, and European cultural
                    influences in <strong>tango.</strong>

                    Various neighborhoods in Buenos Aires have their unique tango histories, such as La Boca, San Telmo,
                    and Boedo, where artists and composers used to gather.

                    In the early 20th century, dancers and orchestras from Buenos Aires traveled to Europe, sparking the
                    first European tango craze in Paris, followed by London, Berlin, and other capitals. Tango historian
                    Nardo Zalko investigated the cultural exchange between Paris and Buenos Aires in his work, "Paris –
                    Buenos Aires, A Century of Tango."

                    By the end of 1913, tango reached New York and Finland. In the U.S., the term "tango" was applied to
                    dances with a 2/4 or 4/4 rhythm, such as the one-step. Tango's controversial nature led to dance
                    teachers being banished from Paris by 1914. More authentic tango stylings developed, including
                    variations like Albert Newman's "Minuet" <strong>tango.</strong>

                    In Argentina, the Great Depression in 1929 and restrictions after the overthrow of the Hipólito
                    Yrigoyen government in 1930 temporarily reduced tango's popularity. However, it regained prominence
                    in the 1930s, becoming a matter of national pride under the first Perón government. Mariano Mores
                    played a role in the tango's resurgence in 1950s Argentina.

                    Tango faced another decline in the late 1950s due to economic depression and military dictatorships
                    banning public gatherings. Yet, it experienced a revival in the late 1980s in Argentina, partly due
                    to the efforts of Osvaldo Peredo.

                    In 2009, tango was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Today, tango remains a
                    captivating and popular dance genre with a rich history of origins, evolution, and cultural
                    interactions.

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>
                    There are several theories regarding the origin of the word tango, none of which has been proven. An
                    African culture is often credited as the creator of this word; in particular, it is theorized that
                    the word derives from the Yoruba word shangó, which refers to Shango, the God of Thunder in
                    traditional Yoruba religion.This theory suggests that the word “shangó” was morphed through the
                    dilution of the Nigerian language once it reached South America via slave trade. According to an
                    alternative theory, tango is derived from the Spanish word for "drum", tambor.This word was
                    then mispronounced by Buenos Aires’ lower-class inhabitants to become tambo, ultimately resulting in
                    the common tango. It is also sometimes theorized that the word is derived from the Portuguese word
                    tanger, which means "to play a musical instrument". Another Portuguese word, tangomão, a combination
                    of the verb tanger ("to touch") with the noun mão ("hand") meaning "to play a musical instrument
                    with one's hands", has been suggested as the etymon of tango.
