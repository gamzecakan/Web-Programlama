                <em>
                    <strong>Rhumba</strong>, also known as <strong>ballroom rumba</strong>, is a genre of ballroom music
                    and dance that appeared in the
                    East Coast of the United States during the 1930s. It combined American big band music with
                    Afro-Cuban rhythms, primarily the son cubano, but also conga and rumba. Although taking its name
                    from the latter, ballroom rumba differs completely from Cuban rumba in both its music and its dance.
                    Hence, authors prefer the Americanized spelling of the word (rhumba) to distinguish between
                    them.

                    Two variations of rhumba with opposing step patterns are danced around the world. American style
                    rumba was imported to America by band directors like Emil Coleman and Don Aspiazú between 1913 and
                    1935. The film <strong>Rhumba</strong>, released in 1935, brought the style to the attention of the
                    general public.
                    American style rhumba is taught in a box step, known for its slow-quick-quick pattern danced on the
                    1, 3, and 4 beats of 4-beat music. International style rhumba was developed in Europe by Monsieur
                    Pierre after he compared the established American style with contemporary Cuban dancers.
                    International style is taught in a quick-quick-slow pattern danced on the 2, 3, and 4 beats of 4
                    beat music, similar in step and motion to the cha-cha-cha.Both styles were canonized in 1955.

                <h2>Music</h2>
                <p>
                    Although the term rhumba began to be used by American record companies to label all kinds of Latin
                    music between 1913 and 1915, the history of rhumba as a specific form of ballroom music can be
                    traced back to May 1930, when Don Azpiazú and his Havana Casino Orchestra recorded their song "El
                    manisero" (The Peanut Vendor) in New York City.This single, released four months later by
                    Victor, became a hit, becoming the first Latin song to sell 1 million copies in the United
                    States.The song, composed by Moisés Simons, is a son-pregón arranged, in this case, for
                    Azpiazú's big band featuring three saxophones, two cornets, banjo, guitar, piano, violin, bass, and
                    trap drums.With vocals by Antonio Machín and a trumpet solo (the first one in the recorded
                    history of Cuban music) by Remberto Lara, the recording, arranged by saxophonist Alfredo Brito,
                    attempted to adapt the Cuban son to the style of ballroom music prevalent at the time in the East
                    Coast.

                    Soon, Azpiazú's style was followed by other Cuban artists such as Armando Oréfiche and the Lecuona
                    Cuban Boys, who had extensive international tours in the 1930s. Their style has been often described
                    as <strong>ballroom conga</strong>, since they used to borrow conga rhythms in songs such as "Para Vigo me voy".
                    Among their numerous hits were boleros and canciones such as "Amapola" and "Siboney".This music
                    movement, which also included many American big bands that covered Latin standards, was dubbed the
                    <strong>rhumba craze.</strong> Notable bandleaders of the rhumba craze include Xavier Cugat, Jimmy Dorsey, Nathaniel
                    Shilkret, Leo Reisman and Enric Madriguera.Rhumba was also incorporated into classical music, as
                    exemplified by symphonic pieces by composers such as George Gershwin, Harl McDonald and Morton
                    Gould.

                    The kind of rhumba introduced into dance salons in America and Europe in the 1930s was characterized
                    by variable tempo, sometimes nearly twice as fast as the modern ballroom rumba, which was developed
                    as a dance in the 1940s and 1950s, when the original music movement had died down. Nonetheless, the
                    rhumba craze would be the first of three Latin music crazes in the first half of the 20th century,
                    together with the mambo craze and the cha-cha-cha craze.
